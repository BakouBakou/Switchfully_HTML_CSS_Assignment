				<h2>Who am I?</h2>
				<p>Hello! My name is Baker. I'm 29 years old and live in Namur.</p>
				<p>I've studied bioengineering at the Catholic University of Louvain-la-Neuve and graduated in 2016. I already had an interest in IT at that time and tried to pick my jobs in consequence. That lead me to work 2 years in testing as a consultant and then 2 years as a business analyst before realizing that it wasn't what I wanted to do. After a little bit of introspection, I dived into the world of programming and quickly realized that this is the professional life I wanted. This website is but one small step towards that goal. <img class='images-in-text' src='images/emoji.png' alt='smiling emoji'/> </p>
				<p>When I'm not working or spending time with friends/family, you can usually find me playing some video games or working out, and this second point is what I chose to cover as <a href='my-website-topic.html'>my topic of interest</a>.</p>
