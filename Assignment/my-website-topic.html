				<h2>My topic of interest: Calisthenics</h2>
				<p>Before the pandemic, I used to go to the gym after work with the humble goal of staying healthy and sweat a little bit. However, 2020 came and ... <img class='images-in-text' src='images/poop.png' alt='poop emoji'/>.</p>
				<p>I started browsing the internet (and mostly YouTube) in search of exercises I could do at home, with limited space, equipment and, sometimes, limited time. This is when I first heard about calisthenics: working out using only bodyweight exercises. Seeing the impressive stuff you can do (such as in the picture above) once you progress and get stronger motivated me to take this seriously and, while I still have a long way to go, this is now something that keeps me busy several hours a week.</p>
				<p class='centered-text'>Examples are much better than a thousand words! Here are 2 YouTube channels I recommend if you would like to check it out</p>

				</ul>
				<p class='centered-text'>That's enough blahblah for today. Time for some action! Get into your sportswear and get ready to sweat <img class='images-in-text' src='images/devil.png' alt='devil emoji'/></p>
